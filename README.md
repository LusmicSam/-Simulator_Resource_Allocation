## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites ✅
- **Python 3.8 or higher** *(for website backend)*  
- **Node.js 14 or higher**  
- **npm 6 or higher**  

### Installation 📥

1. **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-simulator.git
cd rag-simulator
```

2. **Install dependencies**  
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Install backend dependencies** *(for website)*  
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Build the executable** *(optional)*  
```bash
npm run build:exe
```

### Running the Application 🏃‍♂️

#### Website 🌐
1. Start the backend server  
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

2. Start the frontend development server  
```bash
npm run dev
```

*The website will be available at `http://localhost:3000`*

#### Executable 💿
1. Navigate to the `dist` folder  
2. Run the executable file (`rag-simulator.exe` on Windows, etc.)  

---

## Usage 📖

1. Launch the application *(website or exe)*  
2. Create a resource allocation graph using:  
   - The **RAG language** syntax  
   - **Natural language** description  
   - **Visual editor**  
3. Analyze deadlocks and resource utilization  
4. Export and save your graphs  

### RAG Language Example 📝

```plaintext
create_graph {
  processes = [P0, P1];
  resources = [R0(1), R1(1)];
  
  allocations {
    R0 > P0;
    R1 > P1;
  }
  
  requests {
    P0 > R1;
    P1 > R0;
  }
}
```
